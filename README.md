# foobar_solutions

These are my solutions to the [foobar](http://www.google.com/foobar/) questions I solved. I don't expect them to be the best possible implementation, but they passed all test cases and I really enjoyed working on them. I hope they will be useful to others as examples.

each notebook is labeled as:

- `{level #}.{question # within that level}.{name of the problem}`

The information for each problem is contained in the notebook.
