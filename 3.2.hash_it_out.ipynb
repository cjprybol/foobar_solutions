    "Lucky for you nobody is around (do these security minions just sleep all the time?), so you have a chance to examine your cell. Looking around, you see no signs of surveillance (ha, they must underestimate you already) and the only thing keeping you contained is an electronic door lock. Should be easy enough.\n",

    "You and Beta Rabbit worked together to exfiltrate some of Professor Booleans security information in anticipation of a moment just like this one. Time to put it to the test.\n",

    "To open these doors, you will need to reverse engineer the hash function it is using. You already managed to steal the details of the algorithm used, and with some quiet observation of the guards you find out the results of the hash (the digest). Now to break it.\n",
